Hi,
I'm Fien and this is my master thesis :)

Nice things to know:
1. I've put all the code and files in the research map: \\vumc.nl\Onderzoek\s4e-gpfs2\rath-research-01\Research\Fien
2. And the files code should be on my github as well, please note that datasets are not included here for privacy reasons: https://github.com/MariekePop/Generative-Medical-Imaging-and-Tumor-Segmentation
3. For an extensive explanation on how to use the code etc. I refer to the READ ME on the GitHub page. 
4. As for my actual thesis here is the link to my Overleaf file: "https://www.overleaf.com/read/txhzdzhsykbv#dd1881". I've also included a PDF version on GitHub.
5. If you have any questions, please email me on my personal emailadress: fien@dekok.net

Have fun and good luck!
